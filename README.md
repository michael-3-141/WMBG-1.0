Codename: Perlib
======

An android app for remembering all those books you lended.

People lend books to each other all the time, but there is know easy way of remebering who you lended your book to.
That's the idea behind perlib (the codename until I come up with a real name). Perlib lets you easily write down all the books you lend. This is the concept:
1. Someone want to take some book you have. You open the app and scan the ISBN code of the book.
2. You fill in the name of the person and his email, and when you want to send reminders to him.
3. Once he returns the book, you scan the code again and the book gets removed from the list.
Perlib is in early development stages, most of these features aren't implemented yet and the app is still not available on Google Play, but it will be soon! (I hope)
